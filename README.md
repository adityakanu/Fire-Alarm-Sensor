## Introduction

The Fire Sensor Alarm project is designed to detect the presence of flames and unusual temperature changes, indicating a potential fire hazard. When a flame or significant temperature increase is detected, the system activates an alarm to promptly alert users about the potential danger.

## Demo

[Insert a brief description of the demo here. You can also include images or videos to showcase the project in action.]

## Circuit Diagram
